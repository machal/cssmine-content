Responsive Web Design = Web Design
==================================

![Responsive design = web design.](images/prokop-webdesign.jpg)

You can face the advent of mobile phone by creating a special mobile web site -
the "m dot" version with separate style templates. However, many of us have
already found out this approach presents a longterm disadvantage both for the
user and for the web site operator as well.

Therefore, I dare to say that sooner or later we will all end up creating one
web site version - a responsive web site. The "responsive" attribute will then
eventually lose its meaning.

Taken from a certain point of view, the "responsive" term is just an indication
of a temporary web design phase.

At first sight, Media Queries are the only thing that help us tackle CSS3
responsive properties but don't be fooled! From the responsive design point of
view, almost every CSS property explained in the second part of this e-book, is
valuable.
