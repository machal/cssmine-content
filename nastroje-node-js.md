Node.js Invasion
================

Node.js tools were originally meant for development of Javascript apps on a
server. But… Javascript is needed on front-end as well. You do not have to write
hundreds of lines of code but once in a while you will need to, let's say,
install a jQuery plugin.

Therefore we need tools for installing and maintaining packages and something
for building distribution versions of the code as well.

We will be dealing with npm, Bower, Grunt or Gulp. It is good to know that all
these tools come from the world of Node.js.
