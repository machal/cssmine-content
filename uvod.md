Who Is the E-book For and Why Did it Come To Life?
--------------------------------------------------

The very basis of the e-book lie in several years of writing a CSS3 guide at
Vzhůru dolů – <http://www.vzhurudolu.cz/> - a Czech version of CSS Mine.

The text that you have just started to read guides developers through the
current state of the web user interface (UI).

It will be your everyday buddy when applying CSS in practice, helping especially
beginners and intermediate developers. The experienced ones will appreciate a
detailed Flexbox guide and summed principles of coding contemporary websites.

We do coding, i.e. UI development - not front-end programming and Javascript.

What Is It About?
-----------------

The e-bbok consists of two parts:

**Contemporary Website Coding** – how the development of user interface has
changed in recent years and what tools, technologies and approaches are nowadays
commonly used.

**CSS3 Reference Guide** – practical examples and traps to avoid in coder's
everyday life.
