The Arrival of Smartphones
==========================

This is without doubt the most significant change. In a way, the mother of all
changes. I certainly hope there is no doubt about the importance of mobile
devices in the work of a web developer.

At the time of writing, the average mobile device usage when it comes to big
websites is about 15% in the Czech Republic, however the mobile share doubles
every year. I base this number on the Gemius statistics at rankings.cz, but take
a look at your own website stats.

In the rest of the world, web developers must face a share of mobile devices
being over 50%.

You can't hide from mobiles.
