CSS3 Box Shadow
===============

This is a typical shadow attached to an element, usually under the element but
also inside of it or a shadow creating a relief effect.

Syntax
------

```css
box-shadow:
    (inset)
    _horizontal_offset_
    _vertical_offset_
    (_blur_)
    (_spread_)
    _color_,
    (_other_shadows_);
```

The basic shadow can be created in a jiffy. The first number indicates the
**horizontal offset, the second one the vertical one** - a positive value
offsets the shadow down, a negative one up. The third value is color and believe
it or not, the best practice is to use a semi-transparent [RGBa
color](css3-rgba.md). Let's show this on several examples.

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

If we add another number, the browser will indicate that you want to **blur**
the shadow:

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

One more number and you will define the **spread distance**:

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

An **inset** key word changes the shadow from outer to inner:

```css
box-shadow: inset 5px 5px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

You can also create **multiple shadows** by dividing the values by a comma. The
first shadow is the topmost:

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5),
    inset 5px 5px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

Tips and Tricks
---------------

### One Side Shadow

If we want to create a shadow on one side only, just simply set the horizontal
shadow to `0`. However, bear in mind that thanks to using blur, the shadow will
be leaking from the top and bottom:

```css
box-shadow: 5px 0 5px -2px rgba(0,0,0,.5);
```

See a live example at [cdpn.io/e/JnGyb](http://cdpn.io/e/JnGyb).

### Shadow as a Copy of an Object

Drawing a Microsoft logo using a shadow may be rather impractical but it also
demonstrates the power of using multiple shadows without blurring. See an
example at [cdpn.io/e/qJuzw](http://cdpn.io/e/qJuzw).

You can also combine blurred and sharp shadows â€“

Browser Support
---------------

IE9+. There is almost no problem in modern browsers:

### Older Webkit Browsers Sometimes Ignore the Spread

A slight problem in older webkit browsers is that if a value for blur is
missing, they ignore the null value of the spread. Therefore, this notation
won't work in iOS6 Safari or Android Browser 2.3:

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

This one, on the other hand, will:

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
```

See a live example at [cdpn.io/e/FGtbu](http://cdpn.io/e/FGtbu).

### Internet Explorer 8

In IE8, a box shadow can be rendered using the `filter` proprietary property.
Example:

```css
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#cccccc',
  Direction=145, Strength=3);
```

However, not all types of shadows can be substituted like this.

In older versions of Internet Explorer, a shadow can be rendered using a
[css3pie.com](http://css3pie.com/) polyfill but usually, you will get away
with this using the zero fallback strategy.
