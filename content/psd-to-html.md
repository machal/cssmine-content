PSD-to-HTML Effectivity: Avocode, CSSHat…
=========================================

Nowdays, life is simpler thanks to a few tools that convert graphic designs into
CSS and HTML code.

First, there are designing tools that produce code directly - a kind of
Dreamweavers of the responsive age. They include WebFlow
([webflow.com](https://webflow.com/)) and Macaw
([macaw.co](http://macaw.co)), to give you two examples.

A slightly different approach can be seen when using tools that add export
functionality to traditional graphic editors. A typical example of this is CSS
Hat ([csshat.com](https://csshat.com/)). Today’s predominant design tools such
as Adobe Photoshop and Bohemian Coding Sketch are doing export to CSS by
themselves ([bohemiancoding.com/sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)).

Finally, there are tools which connect the worlds of graphic designers and
coders. let’s mention Avocode ([avocode.com](http://avocode.com/)) and
Brackets by Adobe ([brackets.io](http://brackets.io/)).
