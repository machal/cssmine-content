PSD-to-HTML Effectivity: Avocode, CSSHatâ€¦
=========================================

Nowdays, life is simpler thanks to a few tools that convert graphic designs into
CSS and HTML code.

First, there are designing tools that directly produce code - a kind of
Dreamweavers of the responsive age. They are WebFlow
([webflow.com](https://webflow.com/)) or Macaw ([macaw.co](http://macaw.co))
to give you an example.

A slightly different approach might be seen when using tools that add an export
functionality to traditional graphic editors. A typical example of this is CSS
Hat ([csshat.com](https://csshat.com/)). Today's dominating design tools such
as Adobe Photoshop or Bohemian Coding Sketch are doing export to CSS by themselves.

And finally, there are tools which connect the world of graphic designers and
coders. Let's mention Avocode ([avocode.com](http://avocode.com/)) or Brackets
by Adobe ([brackets.io](http://brackets.io/)).
