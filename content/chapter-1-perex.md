# Introduction

Before we dig into CSS3 properties, we have to take a look at today's way of

How has the workflow changed in recent years? Quite a lot.

What tools, technologies and approaches are good to use? [Grunt](building.md), [SVG](transformations-5.md), [NPM & Bower](npm-bower.md),
[Node.js](node-js.md) and many others.

Are you ready for an “avalanche of new terms”?
