Alternative Browser Testing: Browserstack & Co.
===============================================

When it comes to rendering CSS code, there are not many differences among modern
browsers.

Unfortunately, there are tons of browsers plus new arrivals on the mobile field.
And then there are “retired” browsers such as Internet Explorer 8.

Therefore, a coder will not do without alternative browser testing.

You can download alternative operating systems using VirtualBox or similar
programs and then test mobile browsers in emulators and simulators.

Or you can use Browserstack or similar online services. These services host
alternative browsers and provide you with remote access.

It will cost you an insignificant amount of money and compared to the time spent
on maintenance of Android emulators and VirtualBox, it is a bargain.

How To Test Responsive Websites?
--------------------------------

I recommend a three-phase testing:

1.  A desktop computer – I use Chrome, DevTools and mobile resolution emulation.
2.  Simulators/emulators – Browserstack rulez!
3.  Real devices – I use iPhone 4 with iOS, Vodafone 945 with old Android 2.1,
    iPad Mini with iOS8, Tablet Sencor Element 7 with Android 4.1, Samsung
    Galaxy S III mini with Android 4.1 and Nokia Lumia 520 with Windows Phone 8.
