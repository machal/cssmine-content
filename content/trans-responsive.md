Web Design = Responsive Web Design 
==================================

> Today, anything that’s fixed and unresponsive isn’t web design, it’s something else. If you don’t embrace the inherent fluidity of the web, you’re not a web designer, you’re something else. Web design is responsive design, Responsive Web Design is web design, done right.

You can deal with the advent of mobile phones by creating a special mobile
website - an “m dot” version with separate style templates. However, many of us
have already found that this approach represents a long-term disadvantage both
for the user and for the website operator.

Therefore, I dare say that sooner or later we will all end up creating one
version of a website - which will be a responsive website. The “responsive”
attribute will then eventually lose its meaning.

Taken from a certain point of view, the “responsive” term is just an indication
of a temporary web design phase.

At first sight, Media Queries are the only things that help us tackle CSS3
responsive properties, but don’t be fooled! From the responsive design point of
view, almost every CSS property explained in the second part of this e-book is
valuable.
