Other Tools and Websites
========================

Now, let's take it briefly.

HTML5 Please
------------

For each CSS3 (or HTML5) property, this website will tell you under what
conditions it is recommended to use it. In other word, it will tell you whether
to use a particular property, whether to use it using a prefix or a polyfill.
When using certain properties, it is better to wait until they are fully
supported. Just take it as a general recommendation and always take a particular
target audience of your website into account.

Can I Use
---------

“Can I Use” is a web site containing tables with information on which browsers
do support a specific property and which do not. If you want to remember just
one web site, this is the one. This web site can also be interconnected with
your Google Analytics stats. However, it is quite clear that support of browser
properties on a global scale has no real validity when it comes to your own
project. [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com)

Should I Prefix
---------------

Shall I use a prefixed version when using specific CSS3 properties? This website
might come in handy but using an Autoprefixer is a much better solution. You may
find reference to Autoprefixer in the previous chapters of the is e-book.

Modernizr
---------

This is a javascript library for feature detection. Pick a CSS3 or HTML5
features you are using on a particular project and the Modernizr webiste will
generate a piece of code you will insert into your own code. In CSS, you can
then use conditions such as `.no-flexbox .form` and in javascript something like
this: `if (Modernizr.canvas) { … }`. [modernizr.com](https://modernizr.com)

Project Templates
-----------------

If you do not fancy doing projects from scratch, take a look at HTML5
Boilerplate - a default HTML template. It has proved to be effective as a
knowledge base but I do not recommend to use it on real projects.
[html5boilerplate.com](https://html5boilerplate.com)

A more massive project base is Web Starter Kit by Google. Apart from ready-made
HTML, CSS and JS files, you can find a complete Gulp workflow there.
[developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/)

Moreover, a lot of templates (and even quite complex ones) can be found in
Yeoman generators. [yeoman.io/generators/](http://yeoman.io/generators/)

Documentation
-------------

A superb documentation of new web technologies and CSS3 properties can be found
in Mozilla Developer Network.
[developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3).

And just for the record: the content of this e-book can also be found at
[cssmine.com](http://www.cssmine.com).

More Advanced Tools
-------------------

As I have already mentioned in the introduction, it is not wise overrate tools
in general. In this e-book, I focus on beginner and intermediate front-end
developers. If you see yourselves as advanced developers, you should not miss
tools such as Broccoli, Browserify, Webpack or CSSNext. If you are into
Javascript, take a look at Babel and Traceur.

That's it. Enjoy!
