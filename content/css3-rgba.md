CSS3 RGBa Color â€“ Semi-transparent Color
========================================

It is a RGB color with a fourth parameter (a number) which is the alpha
transparency channel.

```css
rgba(_red_, _green_, _blue_, _transparency_);
```

Semi-transparent RGBa colors can be applied anywhere in CSS where a color is
commonly used. Just to mention a few: borders, [shadows](css3-box-shadow.md)
or [gradients](css3-gradients.md).

A Comparison With `opacity`
---------------------------

`opacity: 0.5` will make an element and all its children semi-transparent.

RGBa is a color that can be applied to any element without influencing the rest
of it (e.g. its children). In other words, you can use it for background color
like this: `background: rgba(20%, 100%, 20%, .5)`.

Take a look at [cdpn.io/e/HrBsD](http://cdpn.io/e/HrBsD).

Browser Support
---------------

All browsers except IE8 and older versions have no problem with rendering RGBa.
However, by using a defined fallback, you can respectfully deal with "the
elderly":

```css
color: rgb(128, 0, 0);
color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
```

This fallback will be rendered by modern browsers as a red color with a 50%
transparency. IE8 will render it as a dark shade of red. A fallback color must
be defined with respect to the background color which is black in this case.
