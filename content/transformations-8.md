From Ornament to Typography
===========================

The advent of mobile devices gave birth to minimalistic CSS styles such as Flat
UI or Material Design by Google.

The motives are rather practical. In the responsive web design era, it is not
certain how big an element will eventually be and what the rendering
capabilities of a device will be.

Ornament-rich graphics, in combination with todayâ€™s imperfect workflow, would
gobble up lot of money.

Many web developers complain about this approach because it seems limiting from
the graphical point of view. On the one hand, that is true. On the other, the
web environment has experienced the arrival of a new tool - a new tool for the
web, but an old one for other, different media types. It is called typography.

Typography offers a wide range of possibilities for passing on information
together with emotion or feeling, from the choice of typeface to correct pairing
of fonts and CSS3/SVG effects.

In this e-book, we will take a look at typography from the technical point of
view, dealing with the `@font-face` CSS3 property. However, bear in mind that
typography is also extremely interesting from the graphical point of view. If
