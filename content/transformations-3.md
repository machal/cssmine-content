Too Many Browsers Will Give You a Headache
==========================================

The arrival of the Chrome desktop browser launched new “Browser Wars” and the
first “Battle of Browsers” took place on the mobile device battlefield. Yes,
coders have been better.

So let's take a look at what a relevant browser is:

-   Desktops: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (versions 11, 10, 9, 8), Opera,
    *Safari*
-   Mobile devices: Android Browser (*versions 2.3*, 4.x and 5), Safari Mobile,
    Chrome Mobile, *Internet Explorer Mobile*, *Opera Mini*, *Opera Mobile*

Browsers that need special attention if the website traffic is high, are
highlighted in italics. Also, take a look in your own statistics to see if any
optimization pays off.

You may ask: do I have to optimize for all these browsers? Do not worry.
Ensuring availability of the main content in all browsers is possible even if
you are using CSS3 technologies described in this text.

Now, let's make an exception and focus on one of them.

Mobile Chrome
-------------

The usage share of Chrome on mobile devices is rapidly increasing so it is good
to mention that it has replaced the original browser on new Androids. The one
with the globe icon, labeled “Internet”.

Unlike its “older cousin”, the mobile Chrome will have an automatic update on
some devices. Not to mention that it is much better at supporting CSS3 and other
HTML5 technologies. See

Chrome comes in an iOS version as well, however it is a kind of pseudo-Chrome.

Pseudo-browsers
---------------

In iOS, it is not possible to install a browser with its own rendering engine.
Therefore, iOS Chrome and all other alternative browsers are mere user
interfaces - the actual websites are rendered using mobile Safari.

To give you another example of a pseudo-browser, some statistics show that
websites are accessed through the Facebook interface. Displaying a website in
apps of this social network is possible thanks to a pseudo-browser. The
rendering itself is done using the core of the default browser of a given
platform: using Chrome, an Android browser on Android, mobile Safari on iOS or
Internet Explorer on Windows Phone.
