Who Is the E-book for and Why Was it Written?
---------------------------------------------

The basis of this e-book lies in several years of writing a CSS3 guide at Vzhuru
dolu – [vzhurudolu.cz](http://www.vzhurudolu.cz/) - a Czech version of CSS Mine.

The text you have just started to read guides developers through the current
version of the web user interface (UI).

It will be your everyday buddy when applying CSS in practice, being especially
helpful for beginners and intermediate developers. Experienced users will
appreciate the detailed flexbox guide and the summing up of contemporary website
UI development.

We do front-end coding, i.e. UI development — not front-end programming and
Javascript.

What Is It About?
-----------------

This e-book consists of two parts:

**Contemporary Website UI Development** – how the development of user interfaces
has changed in recent years and what tools, technologies and approaches are
commonly used nowadays.

**CSS3 Reference Guide** – practical examples and traps to avoid in the everyday
life of a coder.
