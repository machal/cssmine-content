Who Is the E-book For and Why Did It Come to Life?
--------------------------------------------------

The very basis of this e-book lies in several years of writing a CSS3 guide at
Vzhuru dolu – [vzhurudolu.cz](http://www.vzhurudolu.cz/) - a Czech version of CSS Mine.

The text you have just started to read guides developers through the current
state of the web user interface (UI).

It will be your everyday buddy when applying CSS in practice, helping especially
beginners and intermediate developers. The experienced ones will appreciate a
detailed flexbox guide and summed principles of contemporary websites UI development.

We do front-end coding, i.e. UI development - not front-end programming and Javascript.

What Is It About?
-----------------

The e-book consists of two parts:

**Contemporary Website UI Development** – how the development of user interface has
changed in recent years and what tools, technologies and approaches are nowadays
commonly used.

**CSS3 Reference Guide** – practical examples and traps to avoid in the everyday
life of a coder.
