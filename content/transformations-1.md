The Arrival of Smartphones
==========================

This is without doubt the most significant change. In a way, the mother of all
changes. I certainly hope there is no doubt about the importance of mobile
devices in the work of a web developer.

At the time of writing, the average mobile device usage when it comes to big
websites is about 15% here, in the Czech Republic, however global numbers are
[close to
50%](http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-monthly-201409-201509). I
base this number on publicly available numbers but take a look at your own
website stats.

In the rest of the world, web developers must face a share of mobile devices
being over 50%.

You can't really hide from mobiles.
