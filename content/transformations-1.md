The Arrival of Smartphones
==========================

This is without a doubt the most significant recent change. In a way, it is the
mother of all changes. I certainly hope you have no doubt about the importance
of mobile devices in the work of a web developer.

At the time of this writing, average mobile device usage, when it comes to big
websites, is about 15% here in the Czech Republic.  However, worldwide, usage is
[closer to
50%](http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-monthly-201409-201509). I
base this figure on publicly available statistics, but take a look at your own
website stats.

In the rest of the world, web developers must expect the share of mobile devices
to be over 50%.

You can’t really hide from mobiles.
