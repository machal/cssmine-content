Less Photoshop, More Code
=========================

What is one of the biggest mistakes in web design? Photoshop, as the leading
creative tool! I am very glad that with the advent of responsive web design, a
general opinion is starting to spread that Photoshop should not play a
significant part in web design. I certainly hope that PSD to HTML coding will
soon end up in a museum, right next to a floppy disk.

How does this relate to CSS3? Somewhat like Tom to Jerry. Meaning very much.

In the “dark ages”, all website graphics that were not possible to tackle using
CSS were exported from Photoshop as images. CSS3 has provided a way to create
not only static graphics but simple interactions as well.

If we can express something using code, it is very simple to interlink the
visual parts with a browser experience. Certain attempts have already been made -
take [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Adobe Edge Reflow](http://www.adobe.com/cz/products/edge-reflow.html) or [WebFlow](https://webflow.com/), for instance. They export code or
parts of it and are certainly much better adapted to the needs of today’s web
design in terms of workflow in that they support SVG and responsive design.

Coders really appreciate tools such as [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) or [Avocode](http://avocode.com/), which address the
issue from their own particular perspectives, generating parts of the code
automatically from the source graphics.

We certainly cannot forget about UI libraries such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Thanks to them,
programmers can do without graphic designers and front-end developers.

Teams that develop their own web products have found that rather than drawing
tons of screens in Photoshop, the most effective way is to create their own
Bootstrap. We call this [style guides](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-pattern-libraries/). Web user interfaces and web apps in
particular can be handled like a jigsaw puzzle made of separate
components - or like reusable LEGO blocks, if you will.

As a front-end designer, I have had interesting experiences with designing
responsive websites in a browser. However, combining HTML and CSS design using a
graphic editor would force me to write a whole book on this topic. So let’s not
go there.

If your team’s workflow allows you to do so, try to experiment and use one of
the above-mentioned approaches.
