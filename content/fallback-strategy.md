Fallback Strategy For Older Browsers
====================================

One of the nice features of HTML and CSS is *dinosaur-resistance*, as I like to
call it. You can use awesome CSS3 or HTML5 features and you will not break the
basic principles of a website in older browsers because they will simply ignore
these features.

Well, maybe if you try, at least a little.

Main Content and Functionality Should Be Available In All Browsers
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you break some irrelevant parts of a website in older browsers, it does not
matter. However, it is almost always possible to provide users with a fully
functional website even in very old browsers, unless you have very good reasons
for not doing so.

It is not just about accessibility and “fair play” towards these disadvantaged
users. It is also about contemporary mobile browsers. Just take the wide range
of Android Browser versions (and supplier modifications), Opera Mini and
e-reader browsers, and so on. It is not humanly possible to test them all. But a
bulletproof solution can do it for you.

And now, imagine browsers that are yet to come - browsers in smart watches,
cars, TVs, and ... well, in fridges. You say people will not use them? It might
be possible but we thought the same about the iPhone browser.

Therefore, using a “*dinosaur-resistant*” technical solution that respects the
lowest common denominator will pay off in the future.

Progressive Enhancement

The aim of progressive enhancement is to guarantee content and main function
accessibility, regardless of the user’s technological equipment.

Progressive enhancement is an approach that will guarantee the
“*dinosaur-resistance*” of your code. So now let’s take a look at various
strategies for older browsers.
