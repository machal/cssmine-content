Node.js Invasion
================

Node.js tools were originally meant for development of Javascript apps on a
server. But - and there is always a “but” - Javascript is needed on the
front-end as well. You do not have to write hundreds of lines of code but once
in a while you will, let's say, need to install a jQuery plugin.

Therefore we need tools for installing and maintaining packages and something
for building distribution versions of the code as well.

We will be dealing with NPM, Bower, Grunt and Gulp. It is good to know that all
these tools come from the world of Node.js.
