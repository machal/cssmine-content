Node.js Invasion
================

Node.js tools were originally meant for development of Javascript apps on a
server. But there is always a “but”… Javascript is needed on the front-end as
well. You do not have to write hundreds of lines of code but once in a while you
will need to, let's say, install a jQuery plugin.

Therefore we need tools for installing and maintaining packages and something
for building distribution versions of the code as well.

We will be dealing with NPM, Bower, Grunt or Gulp. It is good to know that all
these tools come from the world of Node.js.
