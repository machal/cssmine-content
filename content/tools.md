Tools, Approaches, Technologies
===============================

First, let me say that web interface development has recently been focusing a
bit too much on development tools. We spend a lot of time setting up a perfect
workflow in Grunt at the expense of creating a user-oriented product.

The UI developer’s “tool box” should contain more design thinking and less
debugging tools.

Therefore, we will not plunge into the knowledge pool. A lumberjack can get
along with an old chainsaw, if it’s maintained properly and he knows how to use
it. Right?

let’s create an overview of new stuff that CSS has brought out over the past few
years.
