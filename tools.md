Tools, Approaches, Technologies
===============================

First, let me say that web interface development has been recently focusing on
development tools a tad too much. We spend a lot of time setting a perfect
workflow in Grunt at the expense of creating a user oriented product.

The UI developer's "tool box" should contain more design thinking and less
debugging tools.

Therefore, we will not plunge into the knowledge pool. A lumberjack can get
along with an older chainsaw, if it's maintained properly and he knows how to
use it. Right?

Let's create an overview of new stuff that CSS has brought over the past few
years.
