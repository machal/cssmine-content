Bootstrap and ready-made UI Libraries
=====================================

Bootstrap claims to be a front-end framework but, in fact, it's rather a library
of user interface components.

Bootstrap made it easy for programmers who sometimes need to create user
interfaces and are not good at it. If you use Bootstrap this way, all you need
to know is HTML and you can avoid CSS and Javascript.

Another and more interesting way to use Bootstrap is taking it as a starting
point of your custom code. I use it this way and I can't speak highly enough of
it.

What Does Bootstrap Offer?
--------------------------

-   Basic document styles

-   Fully responsive grid for creating layout

-   Advanced styling of basic web site components: forms, buttons, tables...

-   UI components such as navigation tabs, accordions, modal windowsâ€¦

-   jQuery plugins to support the functionality of the above-mentioned UI
    components

-   The ability to change the look and behavior of components using LESS
    variables

Isn't Bootstrap an Overkill?
----------------------------

Yes, it is. If you use it wrong. :-)

Bootstrap sadly acts as a whole although its guts are divided into small
components.

If you choose just the components you will use on a project, both the complexity
and file size will reduce.

When Does Bootstrap Help and when It Does Not?
----------------------------------------------

Bootstrap will help you create web application interfaces like administration,
prototypes or it can help you in general; when you need one of its components.
If you respect its principles, it is also suitable for normal websites. On the
other hand, it is not suitable for unique micro sites.
