From Ornaments to Typography
============================

The advent of mobile devices gave birth to minimalistic CSS styles such as Flat
UI or Material Design by Google.

The motives are rather practical. In the responsive web design era, it is not
certain how big the element will eventually be and what the rendering
capabilities of a device will be.

Ornament-rich graphics in combination with today's imperfect workflow would
swallow a lot of money.

Many web developers complain about this approach as it seems limiting from the
graphical point of view. On one hand, it is true. On the other one, web
environment has experienced the arrival of a new tool. A new tool for the web,
an old one for different media types. It is called typography.

Typography offers a wide range of possibilities on how to pass on information
together with emotion or feeling. From the choice of typeface, to correct font
pairing or CSS3 / SVG effects.

In this e-book, we will take a look at typography from the technical point of
view â€“ we will deal with the `@font-face` CSS3 property. However, bear in mind
that typography is also extremely interesting from the graphical point of view.
