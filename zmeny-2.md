„m dot“ with separate style templates. However, many of us have already found

the website operator.

creating one website version - a responsive website. The „responsive“ attribute
will then eventually lose its meaning.

Taken from a certain point of view, „responsive“ is just an indication of a
temporary web design phase.

responsive properties but don't be fooled. From the responsive design view,

valuable.
