Font Face – Non-technical Aspects
=================================

Two things to be cautious with if you are a web font newbie:

1.  **Copyright (license).** Not all fonts and typefaces are usable on a web
    site free of charge.

2.  **Font rendering in older systems.** You have to check whether a font you
    are using is rendered nicely in the given size in Windows XP (mainly in
    alternative browsers) and older versions of Android. To learn more about
    this problem, go to

Learn Typography
----------------

If you are choosing fonts for your websites, do not forget about the
non-technical aspects. Typography is a serious discipline and not every font is
suitable for every website, as well as not all font pairs work together.

If you are looking for study recourses, I recommend these:

-   [webtypography.net](<http://webtypography.net/>) – it is an older website, but still a
    valid guide to type, typesetting and font composition on a website, written
    by Robert Bringhurst.

-   On Web Typography - it is an impeccable book by Jason Santa Maria,
    especially if you want to understand this topic in the broader context. See

Where To Look For Fonts?
------------------------

### Ideal choice: Typekit.com, Fonts.com, Font Foundries

Typekit.com, Fonts.com and other companies employ top notch typographers and
technicians and have their own licensing of good and well-known fonts. Sure,
they will charge you for their services but you will avoid a lot of problems.

Visiting typographers' websites directly is not a bad choice either.
Even here, in the Czech Republic, we have several good typographers. For example – Tomas Brousil ([suitcasetype.com](<http://suitcasetype.com>)) or Frantisek Storm ([stormtype.com](<http://stormtype.com>)).

### Good alternatives: Google Fonts, Fontsquirrel, etc.

**Google Fonts** is a good service offering a large number of font families for
free. However, not all of them are good and not all of the support languages
with special characters. For more information go to
[google.com/fonts](<http://www.google.com/fonts/>)

**Fontsquirrel** not only have their own database of fonts with similar
advantages and disadvantages like Google does but a well-known font generator
that will make a web font out of your OTF format or other non-web formats.

### Beware of Free Fonts

There are literally hundreds of free fonts scattered around the internet. But
there are very few good ones. A high quality font should have some essential
parameters such as: technical (i.e. file size), typographical (i.e. optimized
web font rendering and readability) and aesthetic.

If you do not have a technician or a typographer at your disposal (or your own
knowledge for that matter), you can spoil your website. There is no shame in
using system fonts.
